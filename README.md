# CustomMessage-ROS-
Task 3 Part 1: Create 2 nodes shared a string message in a custom package

# Robot Operating System
Robot Operating System is robotics middleware. Although ROS is not an operating system, it provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

Nodes: A node is an executable that uses ROS to communicate with other nodes.
Messages: ROS data type used when subscribing or publishing to a topic.
Topics: Nodes can publish messages to a topic as well as subscribe to a topic to receive messages.

 In this task I made a pdf to walk you through how to make workspace, package, nodes publisher and subscribe and share a custome message between them.
